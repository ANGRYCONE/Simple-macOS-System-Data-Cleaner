## What This Script Does

This script performs a full system cleanup on macOS. Here's what it takes care of:

- Deletes user caches from `~/Library/Caches`
- Deletes system caches from `/Library/Caches` and `/System/Library/Caches`
- Removes system and user logs, including diagnostic reports
- Thins Time Machine local snapshots to free up disk space
- Deletes leftover `.ipsw` (iOS update) and `.dmg` (installer) files
- Resets Spotlight indexing for better search performance
- Empties all Trash folders (user, root, and external volumes)

**Warning:** This script uses `sudo` and permanently deletes files. Make sure you know what you're running before executing it.
**Warning 2:** This script does NOT put items in the trash, it instantly deletes files.
